# Fire vs Weather project

This is my first project, so please be understanding.
I present to you a simple model that predicts the number of fire department deployments based on average temperature.
The model works on a linear regression algorithm from sklearn.
I managed to collect metereological data from the wunderground.com website using Selenium.
Enjoy!

The current annotations in Jupyter Notebook are in Polish, so beware.
